  title    = "Year-long, multiple-timepoint field studies show the importance of spatiotemporal dynamics and microbial functions in agricultural soil microbiomes",
  abstract = "Despite the recognition of the complexity of soil ecosystem dynamics, most soil microbiome studies sample one field, take one sample per field, or use limited samples throughout the year. This limits our understanding of the spatiotemporal role of the soil microbiome in relation to management practices. To address these limitations, we conducted a year-long investigation of the soil microbiome in two agricultural fields, sampling multiple plots at different soil depths every 5 weeks. We examined spatial and temporal variabilities in response to the application of organic amendments (one-time biochar and annual compost application) on bacterial and fungal communities, studying both the microbial composition (metabarcoding, phospholipid fatty acids [PLFA], hot-water extractable-carbon) and activity (metatranscriptomics). Indicated by metabarcoding and PLFA, fungal communities were less affected over time per field, whereas bacteria exhibited more pronounced temporal trends. In contrast, fungi displayed clear spatial effects, while bacterial spatial differences within the field were predominantly observed in the deeper soil layer. Effects on functional roles and metabolic processes of the active microbial community were mainly related to temporal trends, especially in the topsoil. Organic amendments did not affect the microbial activity and affected fewer than 2 emphasizing the importance of field-specific factors, sampling depth, and community type. This ushers in the need for a well-considered experimental design and sampling strategy that accounts for spatiotemporal trends.IMPORTANCE This study addresses a critical gap in soil microbiome research by investigating spatiotemporal effects on soil bacterial and fungal composition and activity in relation to field management practices. Moving beyond single-field and limited sampling approaches, this research conducted monthly sampling events on two fields at various depths. By combining metabarcoding, phospholipid fatty acid analysis, and metatranscriptomics, the study examined bacterial and fungal community composition, biomass, and functionality. Key findings reveal distinct responses of bacterial and fungal communities to spatiotemporal variability and management practices. Functional categories were predominantly driven by temporal trends rather than compost amendments. Temporal changes were more pronounced in the topsoil. These insights into the complex interactions between soil microbial communities, management practices, and spatiotemporal dynamics contribute significantly to soil microbiome research and sampling strategies.",

  abstract  = "The mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins (FBs) exert toxicity toward the intestinal epithelial barrier and immune system. Besides, following ingestion of contaminated feed, the intestinal microbiota will be exposed to these toxins. The gut harbours a complex community of over trillions microbial cells which influence animal physiology, metabolism, nutrition and immune function, while disruption of the gut microbiota has been linked with poor intestinal health. The aim of this presentation is to discuss comparatively the impact of mycotoxins on intestinal microbiota composition in broiler chickens and pigs. In a first study, the impact of DON and FBs on the composition of the intestinal microbiota in broiler chickens of different ages was assessed. Chickens of 1 day old were fed either a control diet, a DON contaminated diet (3.3-3.7 mg DON/kg feed) or a FBs contaminated diet (15.5-18.3 mg FB1+FB2/kg feed). Subsequently, after a feeding period of one, three and five weeks chickens were euthanized and ileal and caecal content samples were collected. In a second study, the impact of DON and its acetylated forms on the gut microbiome in piglets of 3 weeks old was investigated. Piglets were fed either a control diet or a DON contaminated diet (0.4 mg DON, 0.3 mg 3-acetylDON, and 0.8 mg 15-acetylDON/kg feed) for 5 weeks. Following euthanasia, colon content samples were collected. Intestinal microbiome profiling was performed by next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. The hyper-variable V4 region was amplified by using the 515F-806R primer set, and the amplicon library was prepared with Nextera adaptors. Subsequently, PCR fragments were sequenced by MiSeq Illumina sequencing (96 samples per lane, 2x300bp 5Gb raw data per lane). The results showed that the impact of DON and FBs on the intestinal microbiota is species- and age-dependent. Mycotoxin exposure modulated the abundance of several members of the family of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcacceae, Peptococaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Veillonellaceae. Several of the affected microbial genera are involved in the production of short-chain fatty acids such as butyric acid.",

  title     = "Draft genome sequencing of Xanthomonas fragariae reveals reduced genome size and distinct virulence related gene content",
  abstract  = "Xanthomonas fragariae (Xf) is a bacterial strawberry pathogen and an A2 quarantine organism on strawberry planting stock in the EU. It is known for its rather weak pathogenicity, fastidious growth on artificial media, its narrow host range and its taxonomically distinct but homogenous position within the otherwise complex genus Xanthomonas. As part of a broader pathogenicity study of Xf, the genome of a recent Belgian isolate (LMG 25863) was sequenced and assembled to draft status, with 105 contigs of more than 200 bp long. Remarkably, the Xf draft genome (4.2 Mb) was considerably smaller than most other Xanthomonas genomes (\textasciitilde{}5 Mb). Compared to other plant pathogenic Xanthomonas, Xf appeared to miss several genes/regions with a possible relevance to pathogenicity: i) an operon involved in the breakdown of phenolic compounds, ii) one of the two Type II Secretion System coding regions in Xanthomonas, iii) isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, responsible for the glyoxylate shunt pathway, and iv) two genes of the rfp gene cluster, rpfD and rpfI. Also, only half of the cellulolytic, hemicellulolytic and pectinolytic enzyme coding genes typically present in other Xanthomonas genomes were found in Xf. On the other hand, we identified possible virulence-related gene regions in Xf that are not common in other Xanthomonas genomes, with a Type VI Secretion System coding region being the most obvious one. Also, the Type III Secretion System effector repertoire in the Xf genome included several rare variable effectors such as xopC, xopE4, xopAF and xopAS, and some putatively new effectors. The Xf draft genome further revealed a high content of externally derived DNA: i) multiple copies of several Insertion Sequence (IS) elements, comparable to Xanthomonas oryzae, ii) a phage coding region, iii) 18-19 kb of sequence fragments with high similarity to Plasmid III (27 kb) of X. albilineans GPE GP73, and iv) a CRISPR associated gene cluster of the Yersinia pestis subtype with 40 related spacer sequences. The draft genome sequence of LMG 25863 affirms the distinct position of Xf within the genus Xanthomonas and reveals a patchwork of both lost and newly acquired pathogenicity related functions. It{\textquoteright}s pathogenicity related distinguishing features may help explain the specific, mostly endophytic association of Xf with the strawberry plant system.",

  abstract  = "Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni (Xap) causes bacterial spot on commercial, ornamental and forest Prunus species. Outbreaks can result in severe economic losses to fruit quality and yield, branch/tree dieback, and orchard devastation, particularly on peach, apricot, nectarine and plum. This stone is endemic in the USA, NZ and is a quarantine regulated pathogen in Europe and elsewhere, compounding economic loss with eradication and regulatory expenses. Wide host range and climate change patterns portend potential increased invasion risk of this pathogen. Despite the regulatory and economic significance of Xap, almost nothing is known about the genetics of Xap compared to other xanthomonads. To fill this gap, a genome sequencing and comparative genomics approach were undertaken. We have sequenced the complete genome of a genotypic-representative Xap strain from Europe (Italy, CFBP 5530). This is the first complete genome sequence for this species. Paired-end 454-pyrosequencing and primer walking on a fosmid library gave 3 contigs. The chromosome is 4.85 Mb with 65.6\% GC ratio and 3,912 predicted CDS. Xap has a unique 41.2 kb plasmid with a 62.3\% GC ratio and 45 CDS. Comparative genomics with other Xanthomonads was used to identify X. arboricola-specific genes indicating features relevant to differential host specificity and virulence mechanisms. Among those, composition and role of type III secretion system effectors repertoires was surveyed within all six X. arboricola pathovars. Applied genomics has identified over 90 VNTR, several of which are currently being used to examine biodiversity and epidemiology of Xap and related pathovars, and design of improved diagnostics. This first complete genome sequence was also successfully used as a template to perform genomic assembly via mapping of short reads of several isolates from related pathovars. For example, the genome of a Xap isolate GBBC 2038 from the ornamental P. laurocerasus was assembled into 93 contigs. These two genomes show very high identity, the main difference being the presence of 10 kb genomic island in the ornamental isolate. Applied and comparative genomics improved our knowledge on host specificity and biodiversity of Xap, and allowed the development of efficient methods for detection of this plant disease. Overall, the availability of the first genome of X. arboricola constitutes a precious knowledge base for better comprehension of all other X. arboricola pathovars.",
